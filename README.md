# Getting Started
0. Make a plugin
   1. create plugin that uses custom-crafter API

1. Install
   1. [Download from here.(GitHub release page)](https://github.com/Sakaki-Aruka/custom-crafter/releases/latest)
   2. Place the downloaded file to plugins directory.
   3. Reboot or reload your server.


2. Place base block  
   custom crafter does not work only a work bench block.  
   If you want to use custom crafter features, place the base blocks under a work bench block 3 * 3.  
   The default base block is `GOLD_BLOCK`.

# Code Example

## Version check
Example code to check if the CustomCrafterAPI version your plugin depends on is fully compatible with the version deployed on your server.
 
````kotlin
class YourPlugin: JavaPlugin() {
    const val DEPEND_CCAPI_VERSION = "0.1.13"
    
    @Override
    fun onEnable() {
        if (!CustomCrafterAPI.hasFullCompatibility(DEPEND_CCAPI_VERSION)) { 
            Bukkit.pluginManager.disablePlugin(this)
            return
        }
    }
}
````

## Recipe
### Make Materials
When creating a custom recipe, you need to specify the arrangement of materials (instances of an implementation class of [CMatterImpl](https://sakaki-aruka.github.io/custom-crafter/custom-crafter/io.github.sakaki_aruka.customcrafter.api.object.matter/-c-matter-impl/index.html) or  [CMatter](https://sakaki-aruka.github.io/custom-crafter/custom-crafter/io.github.sakaki_aruka.customcrafter.api.interfaces.matter/-c-matter/index.html) ) along with their coordinates.  
Below is an example of how to create the material items used in this process.
```Kotlin
// In Kotlin
val matter: CMatter = CMatterImpl(
    name = "test-matter",
    candidate = setOf(Material.STONE, Material.COBBLESTONE),
    amount = 1,
    mass = false,
    predicates = null
)
```

```Kotlin
// In Kotlin
val matter: CMatter = CMatterImpl.single(Material.STONE)
```
This is a common example of creating a Matter that acts as a material when either "Stone" or "Cobblestone" is placed.  
If only one item type is needed in the `candidate` field and other parameters use default values (which makes it almost identical to vanilla Minecraft recipes), you can use the following shorthand:

---

### Make Results
Generally, after defining the materials, the next step is to define the crafting result.  
In CustomCrafter, it is not mandatory to provide an item as a result of crafting. You can also choose to execute a command instead. If you prefer this approach, you can skip this "Results" section and move on to the recipe definition section.

The creation of results in a custom recipe is mainly handled by [ResultSupplier](https://sakaki-aruka.github.io/custom-crafter/custom-crafter/io.github.sakaki_aruka.customcrafter.api.object.result/-result-supplier/index.html) .
It allows you to retrieve various conditions during crafting and determine the final output item accordingly.
```Kotlin
// In Kotlin
val supplier = ResultSupplier { config ->
    // 'config' is 'ResultSupplier.Config' or 'AutoCraftResultSupplier.Config'. 
    // This contains some useful values.
    
    // Write processes here.
    // ResultSupplier is a lambda expression.
    // Return type is `List<ItemStack>`
    emptyList<ItemStack>()
}
```
For recipes that do not require complex processing, CustomCrafter provides simplified versions of the above expression.
```Kotlin
// In Kotlin
val supplier = ResultSupplier.single(ItemStack(Material.STONE))
val supplier2 = ResultSupplier.timesSingle(ItemStack(Material.STONE))
```
[ResultSupplier#single](https://sakaki-aruka.github.io/custom-crafter/custom-crafter/io.github.sakaki_aruka.customcrafter.api.object.result/-result-supplier/-companion/single.html) returns the specified `ItemStack` when the recipe is invoked.
[ResultSupplier#timesSingle](https://sakaki-aruka.github.io/custom-crafter/custom-crafter/io.github.sakaki_aruka.customcrafter.api.object.result/-result-supplier/-companion/times-single.html) is slightly smarter than `single`. When a player crafts multiple items at once (using Shift + Left Click), it multiplies the number of `ItemStack`s provided by the number of times the recipe is invoked.
(It might be easier to understand by testing it yourself. ðŸ™‚)

### Make Recipe
Recipes are the core component of the custom crafting system.  
They group together custom materials and results, registering them in the CustomCrafter system as a single craftable recipe.
The default implementation of recipes is [CRecipeImpl](https://sakaki-aruka.github.io/custom-crafter/custom-crafter/io.github.sakaki_aruka.customcrafter.api.object.recipe/-c-recipe-impl/index.html) , but if you require additional customization, you can implement your own `CRecipe` class.

Below is an example of a simple recipe:
```Kotlin
// In Kotlin
val recipe: CRecipe = CRecipeImpl(
    name = "test-recipe",
    items = mapOf(CoordinateComponent(0, 0) to matter), // 'matter' is CMatter
    containers = null,
    results = setOf(ResultSupplier.timesSingle(Material.STONE)),
    type = CRecipeType.NORMAL
)
```
-   `items`: Specifies the coordinates and corresponding `CMatter` in a map for the crafting grid.
-   `containers`: Defines additional conditions (such as required player permissions) that must be met for the recipe to be crafted. For simple recipes, this is not needed.
-   `results`: A set of `ResultSupplier` instances. If all crafting conditions are met, these are executed, and the resulting items are given to the player.
-   `type`: Specifies the type of the custom recipe. Options include `NORMAL` (shaped recipe) and `AMORPHOUS` (shapeless recipe).  
    If the recipe is shapeless, the `CoordinateComponent` values in `items` can be arbitrary. ðŸ™‚
